## Health Slot

A Vue.js-based frontend system for managing medical appointments. Provides core functionality for patients to book, view, and cancel appointments with healthcare providers.

**🌐 Live Application**: [Access the deployed app here](https://PantaAastha.github.io/health-slot/)

### Features

#### User Flow

- Welcome Screen: Collect patient name and email
- Doctor Selection: List of available medical professionals
- Appointment Scheduling:
  - 30-minute time slots in calendar view
  - Real-time slot status updates with tooltip, where necesary
  - Interactive booking confirmation modal
  - Allows cancellation of the booked slots

#### Slot States

- Available: Open slot that can be booked
- Your Booking: Logged-in user's confirmed appointment
- Booked: Slot reserved by other patients
- Schedule Conflict: When user has booking with another doctor for the same time slot on the same day
- Too Late to Book: 15-minute booking cutoff before appointment time
- Past: Time slots that have already occurred

#### State Management

The application uses Vuex for state management with localStorage integration for data persistence. This allows:

- User session data to persist between page refreshes
- Appointment bookings to be stored locally
- Multiple users to access their own bookings from the same device

**Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized interface

📝 **Note on Booking Availability**:
Appointments can currently be scheduled up to 30 days in advance. The calendar will only display available slots within this 1-month window from the current date.

### Limitations

- No authentication
- Basic UI
- **Timezone Handling**: The app displays time slots in the doctor's timezone (e.g., Australia/Sydney) without adjusting for the user's local timezone.
- **Browser Support**: Currently verified to work optimally on Google Chrome. Cross-browser compatibility with Firefox, Safari, and Edge has not been thoroughly tested.
